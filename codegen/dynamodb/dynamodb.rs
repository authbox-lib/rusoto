	/// For type Binary, DynamoDB treats each byte of the binary data as unsigned when
	/// it compares binary values.
	///   * _ComparisonOperator_ \- A comparator for evaluating attributes in the _AttributeValueList_. When performing the comparison, DynamoDB uses strongly consistent reads.
	/// The following comparison operators are available:
	/// `EQ | NE | LE | LT | GE | GT | NOT_NULL | NULL | CONTAINS | NOT_CONTAINS |
	/// BEGINS_WITH | IN | BETWEEN`
	/// The following are descriptions of each comparison operator.

	/// _AttributeValueList_ can contain only one _AttributeValue_ element of type
	/// String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item
	/// contains an _AttributeValue_ element of a different type than the one provided

	/// equal `{"N":"6"}`. Also, `{"N":"6"}` does not equal `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}`.
	///     * `NE` : Not equal. `NE` is supported for all datatypes, including lists and maps.
	/// _AttributeValueList_ can contain only one _AttributeValue_ of type String,
	/// Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item contains an
	/// _AttributeValue_ of a different type than the one provided in the request, the

	/// _AttributeValueList_ can contain only one _AttributeValue_ element of type
	/// String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an
	/// _AttributeValue_ element of a different type than the one provided in the

	/// `{"N":"6"}`. Also, `{"N":"6"}` does not compare to `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}`.
	///     * `NOT_NULL` : The attribute exists. `NOT_NULL` is supported for all datatypes, including lists and maps.
	/// This operator tests for the existence of an attribute, not its data type. If
	/// the data type of attribute "`a`" is null, and you evaluate it using
	/// `NOT_NULL`, the result is a Boolean _true_. This result is because the
	/// attribute "`a`" exists; its data type is not relevant to the `NOT_NULL`
	/// comparison operator.
	///     * `NULL` : The attribute does not exist. `NULL` is supported for all datatypes, including lists and maps.
	/// This operator tests for the nonexistence of an attribute, not its data type.
	/// If the data type of attribute "`a`" is null, and you evaluate it using `NULL`,
	/// the result is a Boolean _false_. This is because the attribute "`a`" exists;
	/// its data type is not relevant to the `NULL` comparison operator.
	///     * `CONTAINS` : Checks for a subsequence, or value in a set.
	/// _AttributeValueList_ can contain only one _AttributeValue_ element of type
	/// String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If the target attribute of the
	/// comparison is of type String, then the operator checks for a substring match.
	/// If the target attribute of the comparison is of type Binary, then the operator
	/// looks for a subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the target
	/// attribute of the comparison is a set ("`SS`", "`NS`", or "`BS`"), then the
	/// operator evaluates to true if it finds an exact match with any member of the
	/// set.
	/// CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating "`a CONTAINS b`", "`a`" can
	/// be a list; however, "`b`" cannot be a set, a map, or a list.
	///     * `NOT_CONTAINS` : Checks for absence of a subsequence, or absence of a value in a set.
	/// _AttributeValueList_ can contain only one _AttributeValue_ element of type
	/// String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If the target attribute of the
	/// comparison is a String, then the operator checks for the absence of a
	/// substring match. If the target attribute of the comparison is Binary, then the
	/// operator checks for the absence of a subsequence of the target that matches
	/// the input. If the target attribute of the comparison is a set ("`SS`", "`NS`",
	/// or "`BS`"), then the operator evaluates to true if it _does not_ find an exact
	/// match with any member of the set.
	/// NOT_CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating "`a NOT CONTAINS b`",
	/// "`a`" can be a list; however, "`b`" cannot be a set, a map, or a list.
	///     * `BEGINS_WITH` : Checks for a prefix. 
	/// _AttributeValueList_ can contain only one _AttributeValue_ of type String or
	/// Binary (not a Number or a set type). The target attribute of the comparison
	/// must be of type String or Binary (not a Number or a set type).
	///     * `IN` : Checks for matching elements within two sets.
	/// _AttributeValueList_ can contain one or more _AttributeValue_ elements of type
	/// String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). These attributes are compared
	/// against an existing set type attribute of an item. If any elements of the
	/// input set are present in the item attribute, the expression evaluates to true.
	///     * `BETWEEN` : Greater than or equal to the first value, and less than or equal to the second value. 
	/// _AttributeValueList_ must contain two _AttributeValue_ elements of the same
	/// type, either String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). A target attribute
	/// matches if the target value is greater than, or equal to, the first element
	/// and less than, or equal to, the second element. If an item contains an
	/// _AttributeValue_ element of a different type than the one provided in the
	/// request, the value does not match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not compare
	/// to `{"N":"6"}`. Also, `{"N":"6"}` does not compare to `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}`
	/// For usage examples of _AttributeValueList_ and _ComparisonOperator_, see
	/// [Legacy Conditional Parameters](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/late
	/// st/developerguide/LegacyConditionalParameters.html) in the _Amazon DynamoDB
	/// Developer Guide_.
	/// For backward compatibility with previous DynamoDB releases, the following
	/// parameters can be used instead of _AttributeValueList_ and
	/// _ComparisonOperator_:
	///   * _Value_ \- A value for DynamoDB to compare with an attribute.
	///   * _Exists_ \- A Boolean value that causes DynamoDB to evaluate the value before attempting the conditional operation:
	///     * If _Exists_ is `true`, DynamoDB will check to see if that attribute value already exists in the table. If it is found, then the condition evaluates to true; otherwise the condition evaluate to false.
	///     * If _Exists_ is `false`, DynamoDB assumes that the attribute value does _not_ exist in the table. If in fact the value does not exist, then the assumption is valid and the condition evaluates to true. If the value is found, despite the assumption that it does not exist, the condition evaluates to false.
	/// Note that the default value for _Exists_ is `true`.
	/// The _Value_ and _Exists_ parameters are incompatible with _AttributeValueList_
	/// and _ComparisonOperator_. Note that if you use both sets of parameters at
	/// once, DynamoDB will return a _ValidationException_ exception.

	///     * `DELETE` \- Removes the attribute and its value, if no value is specified for `DELETE`. The data type of the specified value must match the existing value's data type.

	/// doesn't exist before the update, DynamoDB uses 0 as the initial value.
	/// Similarly, if you use `ADD` for an existing item to increment or decrement an
	/// attribute value that doesn't exist before the update, DynamoDB uses `0` as the
	/// initial value. For example, suppose that the item you want to update doesn't
	/// have an attribute named _itemcount_, but you decide to `ADD` the number `3` to
	/// this attribute anyway. DynamoDB will create the _itemcount_ attribute, set its
	/// initial value to `0`, and finally add `3` to it. The result will be a new
	/// _itemcount_ attribute, with a value of `3`.
	///       * If the existing data type is a set, and if _Value_ is also a set, then _Value_ is appended to the existing set. For example, if the attribute value is the set `[1,2]`, and the `ADD` action specified `[3]`, then the final attribute value is `[1,2,3]`. An error occurs if an `ADD` action is specified for a set attribute and the attribute type specified does not match the existing set type. 
	/// Both sets must have the same primitive data type. For example, if the existing
	/// data type is a set of strings, _Value_ must also be a set of strings.
	/// If no item with the specified key is found in the table, the following values
	/// perform the following actions:
	///     * `PUT` \- Causes DynamoDB to create a new item with the specified primary key, and then adds the attribute. 
	///     * `DELETE` \- Nothing happens, because attributes cannot be deleted from a nonexistent item. The operation succeeds, but DynamoDB does not create a new item.
	///     * `ADD` \- Causes DynamoDB to create an item with the supplied primary key and number (or set of numbers) for the attribute value. The only data types allowed are Number and Number Set.

	/// An expression that defines one or more attributes to be updated, the action to
	/// be performed on them, and new value(s) for them.
	/// The following action values are available for _UpdateExpression_.
	///   * `SET` \- Adds one or more attributes and values to an item. If any of these attribute already exist, they are replaced by the new values. You can also use `SET` to add or subtract from an attribute that is of type Number. For example: `SET myNum = myNum + :val`
	/// `SET` supports the following functions:
	///     * `if_not_exists (path, operand)` \- if the item does not contain an attribute at the specified path, then `if_not_exists` evaluates to operand; otherwise, it evaluates to path. You can use this function to avoid overwriting an attribute that may already be present in the item.
	///     * `list_append (operand, operand)` \- evaluates to a list with a new element added to it. You can append the new element to the start or the end of the list by reversing the order of the operands.
	/// These function names are case-sensitive.
	///   * `REMOVE` \- Removes one or more attributes from an item.
	///   * `ADD` \- Adds the specified value to the item, if the attribute does not already exist. If the attribute does exist, then the behavior of `ADD` depends on the data type of the attribute:
	///     * If the existing attribute is a number, and if _Value_ is also a number, then _Value_ is mathematically added to the existing attribute. If _Value_ is a negative number, then it is subtracted from the existing attribute.
	/// If you use `ADD` to increment or decrement a number value for an item that
	/// doesn't exist before the update, DynamoDB uses `0` as the initial value.
	/// Similarly, if you use `ADD` for an existing item to increment or decrement an
	/// attribute value that doesn't exist before the update, DynamoDB uses `0` as the
	/// initial value. For example, suppose that the item you want to update doesn't
	/// have an attribute named _itemcount_, but you decide to `ADD` the number `3` to
	/// this attribute anyway. DynamoDB will create the _itemcount_ attribute, set its
	/// initial value to `0`, and finally add `3` to it. The result will be a new
	/// _itemcount_ attribute in the item, with a value of `3`.
	///     * If the existing data type is a set and if _Value_ is also a set, then _Value_ is added to the existing set. For example, if the attribute value is the set `[1,2]`, and the `ADD` action specified `[3]`, then the final attribute value is `[1,2,3]`. An error occurs if an `ADD` action is specified for a set attribute and the attribute type specified does not match the existing set type. 
	/// Both sets must have the same primitive data type. For example, if the existing
	/// data type is a set of strings, the _Value_ must also be a set of strings.
	/// The `ADD` action only supports Number and set data types. In addition, `ADD`
	/// can only be used on top-level attributes, not nested attributes.
	///   * `DELETE` \- Deletes an element from a set.
	/// If a set of values is specified, then those values are subtracted from the old
	/// set. For example, if the attribute value was the set `[a,b,c]` and the
	/// `DELETE` action specifies `[a,c]`, then the final attribute value is `[b]`.
	/// Specifying an empty set is an error.
	/// The `DELETE` action only supports set data types. In addition, `DELETE` can
	/// only be used on top-level attributes, not nested attributes.
	/// You can have many actions in a single expression, such as the following: `SET
	/// a=:value1, b=:value2 DELETE :value3, :value4, :value5`
	/// For more information on update expressions, see [Modifying Items and Attribute
	/// s](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions
	/// .Modifying.html) in the _Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide_.
	/// _UpdateExpression_ replaces the legacy _AttributeUpdates_ parameter.
	pub UpdateExpression: Option<UpdateExpression>,
	/// One or more values that can be substituted in an expression.
	/// Use the **:** (colon) character in an expression to dereference an attribute
	/// value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check whether the value of the
	/// _ProductStatus_ attribute was one of the following:
	/// `Available | Backordered | Discontinued`
	/// You would first need to specify _ExpressionAttributeValues_ as follows:
	/// `{ ":avail":{"S":"Available"}, ":back":{"S":"Backordered"},
	/// ":disc":{"S":"Discontinued"} }`
	/// You could then use these values in an expression, such as this:
	/// `ProductStatus IN (:avail, :back, :disc)`
	/// For more information on expression attribute values, see [Specifying Condition
	/// s](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions
	/// .SpecifyingConditions.html) in the _Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide_.
	pub ExpressionAttributeValues: Option<ExpressionAttributeValueMap>,
	/// The primary key of the item to be updated. Each element consists of an
	/// attribute name and a value for that attribute.
	/// For the primary key, you must provide all of the attributes. For example, with
	/// a hash type primary key, you only need to provide the hash attribute. For a
	/// hash-and-range type primary key, you must provide both the hash attribute and
	/// the range attribute.
	pub Key: Key,
	/// This is a legacy parameter, for backward compatibility. New applications
	/// should use _ ConditionExpression _ instead. Do not combine legacy parameters
	/// and expression parameters in a single API call; otherwise, DynamoDB will
	/// return a _ValidationException_ exception.
	/// A map of attribute/condition pairs. _Expected_ provides a conditional block
	/// for the _UpdateItem_ operation.
	/// Each element of _Expected_ consists of an attribute name, a comparison
	/// operator, and one or more values. DynamoDB compares the attribute with the
	/// value(s) you supplied, using the comparison operator. For each _Expected_
	/// element, the result of the evaluation is either true or false.
	/// If you specify more than one element in the _Expected_ map, then by default
	/// all of the conditions must evaluate to true. In other words, the conditions
	/// are ANDed together. (You can use the _ConditionalOperator_ parameter to OR the
	/// conditions instead. If you do this, then at least one of the conditions must
	/// evaluate to true, rather than all of them.)
	/// If the _Expected_ map evaluates to true, then the conditional operation
	/// succeeds; otherwise, it fails.
	/// _Expected_ contains the following:
	///   * _AttributeValueList_ \- One or more values to evaluate against the supplied attribute. The number of values in the list depends on the _ComparisonOperator_ being used.
	/// For type Number, value comparisons are numeric.
	/// String value comparisons for greater than, equals, or less than are based on
	/// ASCII character code values. For example, `a` is greater than `A`, and `a` is
	/// greater than `B`. For a list of code values, see
	/// <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters>.
	/// For type Binary, DynamoDB treats each byte of the binary data as unsigned when
	/// it compares binary values.
	///   * _ComparisonOperator_ \- A comparator for evaluating attributes in the _AttributeValueList_. When performing the comparison, DynamoDB uses strongly consistent reads.
	/// The following comparison operators are available:
	/// `EQ | NE | LE | LT | GE | GT | NOT_NULL | NULL | CONTAINS | NOT_CONTAINS |
	/// BEGINS_WITH | IN | BETWEEN`
	/// The following are descriptions of each comparison operator.
	///     * `EQ` : Equal. `EQ` is supported for all datatypes, including lists and maps.
	/// _AttributeValueList_ can contain only one _AttributeValue_ element of type
	/// String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item
	/// contains an _AttributeValue_ element of a different type than the one provided
	/// in the request, the value does not match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not
	/// equal `{"N":"6"}`. Also, `{"N":"6"}` does not equal `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}`.
	///     * `NE` : Not equal. `NE` is supported for all datatypes, including lists and maps.
	/// _AttributeValueList_ can contain only one _AttributeValue_ of type String,
	/// Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item contains an
	/// _AttributeValue_ of a different type than the one provided in the request, the
	/// value does not match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not equal `{"N":"6"}`.
	/// Also, `{"N":"6"}` does not equal `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}`.
	///     * `LE` : Less than or equal. 
	/// _AttributeValueList_ can contain only one _AttributeValue_ element of type
	/// String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an
	/// _AttributeValue_ element of a different type than the one provided in the
	/// request, the value does not match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not equal
	/// `{"N":"6"}`. Also, `{"N":"6"}` does not compare to `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}`.
	///     * `LT` : Less than. 
	/// _AttributeValueList_ can contain only one _AttributeValue_ of type String,
	/// Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an _AttributeValue_
	/// element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value

	/// `{"N":"6"}` does not compare to `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}`.
	///     * `GE` : Greater than or equal. 
	/// _AttributeValueList_ can contain only one _AttributeValue_ element of type
	/// String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an
	/// _AttributeValue_ element of a different type than the one provided in the
	/// request, the value does not match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not equal
	/// `{"N":"6"}`. Also, `{"N":"6"}` does not compare to `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}`.
	///     * `GT` : Greater than. 
	/// _AttributeValueList_ can contain only one _AttributeValue_ element of type
	/// String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an
	/// _AttributeValue_ element of a different type than the one provided in the
	/// request, the value does not match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not equal
	/// `{"N":"6"}`. Also, `{"N":"6"}` does not compare to `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}`.
	///     * `NOT_NULL` : The attribute exists. `NOT_NULL` is supported for all datatypes, including lists and maps.
	/// This operator tests for the existence of an attribute, not its data type. If
	/// the data type of attribute "`a`" is null, and you evaluate it using
	/// `NOT_NULL`, the result is a Boolean _true_. This result is because the
	/// attribute "`a`" exists; its data type is not relevant to the `NOT_NULL`
	/// comparison operator.
	///     * `NULL` : The attribute does not exist. `NULL` is supported for all datatypes, including lists and maps.
	/// This operator tests for the nonexistence of an attribute, not its data type.
	/// If the data type of attribute "`a`" is null, and you evaluate it using `NULL`,
	/// the result is a Boolean _false_. This is because the attribute "`a`" exists;
	/// its data type is not relevant to the `NULL` comparison operator.
	///     * `CONTAINS` : Checks for a subsequence, or value in a set.
	/// _AttributeValueList_ can contain only one _AttributeValue_ element of type
	/// String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If the target attribute of the
	/// comparison is of type String, then the operator checks for a substring match.
	/// If the target attribute of the comparison is of type Binary, then the operator
	/// looks for a subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the target
	/// attribute of the comparison is a set ("`SS`", "`NS`", or "`BS`"), then the
	/// operator evaluates to true if it finds an exact match with any member of the
	/// set.
	/// CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating "`a CONTAINS b`", "`a`" can
	/// be a list; however, "`b`" cannot be a set, a map, or a list.
	///     * `NOT_CONTAINS` : Checks for absence of a subsequence, or absence of a value in a set.
	/// _AttributeValueList_ can contain only one _AttributeValue_ element of type
	/// String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If the target attribute of the
	/// comparison is a String, then the operator checks for the absence of a
	/// substring match. If the target attribute of the comparison is Binary, then the
	/// operator checks for the absence of a subsequence of the target that matches
	/// the input. If the target attribute of the comparison is a set ("`SS`", "`NS`",
	/// or "`BS`"), then the operator evaluates to true if it _does not_ find an exact
	/// match with any member of the set.
	/// NOT_CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating "`a NOT CONTAINS b`",
	/// "`a`" can be a list; however, "`b`" cannot be a set, a map, or a list.
	///     * `BEGINS_WITH` : Checks for a prefix. 
	/// _AttributeValueList_ can contain only one _AttributeValue_ of type String or
	/// Binary (not a Number or a set type). The target attribute of the comparison
	/// must be of type String or Binary (not a Number or a set type).
	///     * `IN` : Checks for matching elements within two sets.
	/// _AttributeValueList_ can contain one or more _AttributeValue_ elements of type
	/// String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). These attributes are compared
	/// against an existing set type attribute of an item. If any elements of the
	/// input set are present in the item attribute, the expression evaluates to true.
	///     * `BETWEEN` : Greater than or equal to the first value, and less than or equal to the second value. 
	/// _AttributeValueList_ must contain two _AttributeValue_ elements of the same
	/// type, either String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). A target attribute
	/// matches if the target value is greater than, or equal to, the first element
	/// and less than, or equal to, the second element. If an item contains an
	/// _AttributeValue_ element of a different type than the one provided in the
	/// request, the value does not match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not compare
	/// to `{"N":"6"}`. Also, `{"N":"6"}` does not compare to `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}`
	/// For usage examples of _AttributeValueList_ and _ComparisonOperator_, see
	/// [Legacy Conditional Parameters](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/late
	/// st/developerguide/LegacyConditionalParameters.html) in the _Amazon DynamoDB
	/// Developer Guide_.
	/// For backward compatibility with previous DynamoDB releases, the following
	/// parameters can be used instead of _AttributeValueList_ and
	/// _ComparisonOperator_:
	///   * _Value_ \- A value for DynamoDB to compare with an attribute.
	///   * _Exists_ \- A Boolean value that causes DynamoDB to evaluate the value before attempting the conditional operation:
	///     * If _Exists_ is `true`, DynamoDB will check to see if that attribute value already exists in the table. If it is found, then the condition evaluates to true; otherwise the condition evaluate to false.
	///     * If _Exists_ is `false`, DynamoDB assumes that the attribute value does _not_ exist in the table. If in fact the value does not exist, then the assumption is valid and the condition evaluates to true. If the value is found, despite the assumption that it does not exist, the condition evaluates to false.
	/// Note that the default value for _Exists_ is `true`.
	/// The _Value_ and _Exists_ parameters are incompatible with _AttributeValueList_
	/// and _ComparisonOperator_. Note that if you use both sets of parameters at
	/// once, DynamoDB will return a _ValidationException_ exception.
	/// This parameter does not support attributes of type List or Map.

	/// value but different range key values.
	/// The hash key equality test is required, and must be specified in the following
	/// format:
	/// `hashAttributeName` _=_ `:hashval`
	/// If you also want to provide a range key condition, it must be combined using

	/// comparison operator for the range key:
	/// `hashAttributeName` _=_ `:hashval` _AND_ `rangeAttributeName` _=_ `:rangeval`
	/// Valid comparisons for the range key condition are as follows:
	///   * `rangeAttributeName` _=_ `:rangeval` \- true if the range key is equal to `:rangeval`.
	///   * `rangeAttributeName` _&lt;_ `:rangeval` \- true if the range key is less than `:rangeval`.
	///   * `rangeAttributeName` _&lt;=_ `:rangeval` \- true if the range key is less than or equal to `:rangeval`.
	///   * `rangeAttributeName` _&gt;_ `:rangeval` \- true if the range key is greater than `:rangeval`.
	///   * `rangeAttributeName` _&gt;= _`:rangeval` \- true if the range key is greater than or equal to `:rangeval`.
	///   * `rangeAttributeName` _BETWEEN_ `:rangeval1` _AND_ `:rangeval2` \- true if the range key is greater than or equal to `:rangeval1`, and less than or equal to `:rangeval2`.

	/// Use the _ExpressionAttributeValues_ parameter to replace tokens such as
	/// `:hashval` and `:rangeval` with actual values at runtime.
	/// You can optionally use the _ExpressionAttributeNames_ parameter to replace the

	/// `[b]`. Specifying an empty set is an error.
	///   * `ADD` \- If the attribute does not already exist, then the attribute and its values are added to the item. If the attribute does exist, then the behavior of `ADD` depends on the data type of the attribute:

	/// `{"N":"6"}`. Also, `{"N":"6"}` does not compare to `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}`.
	///   * `NOT_NULL` : The attribute exists. `NOT_NULL` is supported for all datatypes, including lists and maps.
	/// This operator tests for the existence of an attribute, not its data type. If
	/// the data type of attribute "`a`" is null, and you evaluate it using
	/// `NOT_NULL`, the result is a Boolean _true_. This result is because the
	/// attribute "`a`" exists; its data type is not relevant to the `NOT_NULL`
	/// comparison operator.
	///   * `NULL` : The attribute does not exist. `NULL` is supported for all datatypes, including lists and maps.
	/// This operator tests for the nonexistence of an attribute, not its data type.
	/// If the data type of attribute "`a`" is null, and you evaluate it using `NULL`,
	/// the result is a Boolean _false_. This is because the attribute "`a`" exists;
	/// its data type is not relevant to the `NULL` comparison operator.
	///   * `CONTAINS` : Checks for a subsequence, or value in a set.
	/// _AttributeValueList_ can contain only one _AttributeValue_ element of type
	/// String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If the target attribute of the
	/// comparison is of type String, then the operator checks for a substring match.
	/// If the target attribute of the comparison is of type Binary, then the operator
	/// looks for a subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the target
	/// attribute of the comparison is a set ("`SS`", "`NS`", or "`BS`"), then the
	/// operator evaluates to true if it finds an exact match with any member of the
	/// set.
	/// CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating "`a CONTAINS b`", "`a`" can
	/// be a list; however, "`b`" cannot be a set, a map, or a list.
	///   * `NOT_CONTAINS` : Checks for absence of a subsequence, or absence of a value in a set.
	/// _AttributeValueList_ can contain only one _AttributeValue_ element of type
	/// String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If the target attribute of the
	/// comparison is a String, then the operator checks for the absence of a
	/// substring match. If the target attribute of the comparison is Binary, then the
	/// operator checks for the absence of a subsequence of the target that matches
	/// the input. If the target attribute of the comparison is a set ("`SS`", "`NS`",
	/// or "`BS`"), then the operator evaluates to true if it _does not_ find an exact
	/// match with any member of the set.
	/// NOT_CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating "`a NOT CONTAINS b`",
	/// "`a`" can be a list; however, "`b`" cannot be a set, a map, or a list.
	///   * `BEGINS_WITH` : Checks for a prefix. 
	/// _AttributeValueList_ can contain only one _AttributeValue_ of type String or
	/// Binary (not a Number or a set type). The target attribute of the comparison
	/// must be of type String or Binary (not a Number or a set type).
	///   * `IN` : Checks for matching elements within two sets.
	/// _AttributeValueList_ can contain one or more _AttributeValue_ elements of type
	/// String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). These attributes are compared
	/// against an existing set type attribute of an item. If any elements of the
	/// input set are present in the item attribute, the expression evaluates to true.
	///   * `BETWEEN` : Greater than or equal to the first value, and less than or equal to the second value. 
	/// _AttributeValueList_ must contain two _AttributeValue_ elements of the same
	/// type, either String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). A target attribute
	/// matches if the target value is greater than, or equal to, the first element
	/// and less than, or equal to, the second element. If an item contains an
	/// _AttributeValue_ element of a different type than the one provided in the
